# üåã INF-LLaVA: Dual-perspective Perception for High-Resolution Multimodal Large Language Model
This repository contains the Pytorch code and model weight of **INF-LLaVA**, a novel MLLM designed for high-resolution image perception and reasoning.

**INF-LLaVA** has the following features to process high-resolution images:
-  **Dual-perspective Cropping Module(DCM)** : Integrate both global and local perspectives when cropping high-resolution images into subimages. This enhances the model‚Äôs ability to capture detailed and contextual information.
-  **Dual-perspective Enhancement Module(DEM)** : An effective and efficient module for fusing dual-perspective features, resulting in dual-enhanced
features that significantly improve performance.
- **Strong Performance** : **INF-LLaVA** outperforms existing models on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Check out our [model zoo](#model-zoo).

cd INF-LLaVA
bash INF-LLava_finetune.sh
```
**Note:** You should replace the data_path and image_folder in the `INF-LLava_finetune.sh`

You can download our pretrained weights in [Model Zoo](#model-zoo) 

# Evaluate

We follow [lmm-eval](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval/) to conduct evaluations. Please refer to [lmm-eval](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval/) for help. We provide the same script to complete the testing.
